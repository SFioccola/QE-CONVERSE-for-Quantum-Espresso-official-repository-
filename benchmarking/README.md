This folder contains the PbF family radicals used to benchmaring the QE-CONVERSE code which the results are presented 
in "Benchmaring test" paragraph of the paper.

NOTE: in order to decrease the computation effort we have reduced the cubic cell volume to 1185 Ang^3 against the 8000 Ang^3 reported in the paper.
      So, the results here might be slightly different from the Table 1.
