!    total energy              =     -11.25983251 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          5.9E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =     -20.57141981 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      10.73884277 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -4.37306042 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       2.94580495 Ry

     total magnetization       =     1.00 Bohr mag/cell
     absolute magnetization    =     1.05 Bohr mag/cell
