Here you can find short tutorials on how to calculate the EPR g tensor for the radical H2O+ with QE-CONVERSE code.
You have to execute three step:

1) A spin-polarized SCF calculation
2) delta-g tensor calculation
3) g tensor extrapolation

You can find all the calculations done in the directory /reference/

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) SCF calculation

You have to perform a spin-polarized SCF calculation using the PW code of Quantum-ESPRESSO on a geometrically optimized structure. 
In this directory you can find the PW input for the radical H2O+:

$ pw.x < h2o+_scf.in > h2o+_scf.out

The input must contain the flag `nspin=2` and `tot_magnetization = 1.0` since it's a magnetic molecule.
For cystal systems the symmetry must be switched off using `nosym=.true.` and `noinv=.true.`. For isolated systems is not strictly necessary.

2) delta-g tensor calculation

Replace "your_path" in `g-tensor_script.sh` script with the folder containing your QE-CONVERSE installation.
Executing the bash script `g-tensor_script.sh` you compute the 3x3 delta-g tensor:

./g-tensor_script.sh

{{{
#!/bin/sh
NAME="h2o+_gtensor"

for DIR in 1 2 3
do
cat > ${NAME}_${DIR}.in << EOF

&input_qeconverse
        prefix = 'h2o+'
        outdir = './scratch/'
        diagonalization = 'david'
        verbosity = 'high'
        q_gipaw = 0.01
        dudk_method = 'covariant'
        diago_thr_init = 1d-4
        conv_threshold = 1d-8
        mixing_beta = 0.5
        lambda_so(${DIR}) = 1.0
/
EOF

mpirun -np 6 "your_path"/bin/qe-converse.x  < ${NAME}_${DIR}.in > ${NAME}_${DIR}.out
echo ${NAME}_${DIR}

done
}}}


You obtain the following 3x3 tensor:

12702.6716     0.0059     -0.0014
-0.0011        4485.7369   0.0011
-0.0005        0.0053     -219.5703

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

3) g tensor extrapolation

First, you have to diagonalize the delta-g tensor :

12703  0.0000   0.000
0.000  4485.7   0.000
0.000  0.0000  -219.57

Now you can extrapolate the g tensor using the relationship :

g tensor = delta-g*10^-06 + ge

where ge = 2.002319

g1 = 2.0150  g2 = 2.0068  g3 =2.0021
